            <p>German-Australian fashion photographer. He pioneered "provocative" fashion photography, and still is the source of inspiration for many commercial photographers. He is a master in black and white photography, and genius in composition. See it yourself!</p>

            <img src="images/daido.jpg" alt="Daidō Moriyama" id="daido">
            <p>Japan pioneered abstract photography in the 60s (totally messy, maybe blurry, but cool photos). Other than Araki, Moriyama is the most notable photographer of this genre, noted for his depiction the breakdown of traditional values in post-war Japan. Google him, and you'll see countrless great photos that will fit well as Grunge album covers.</p>
